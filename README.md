# python-challenge

In this challenge, we were asked to create scripts to read in and provide basic statistical information about increasingly large data sets.  I used the panda library and dataframes extensively in order to quickly calculate the totals, averages and percentages requested and it was also invaluable in investigating a data set that was too big to open in Excel.  

So far, this has been the most useful assignment as I have immediately begun using it in the workplace to do basic analysis and cleaning of large data sets.
